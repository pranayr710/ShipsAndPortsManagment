# ShipsAndPortsManagment

Welcome to the "Ship and Port Container Management Simulation" project! This project tackles the complex and dynamic challenge of managing ships, ports, and various types of containers integral to global logistics. From basic goods to heavy machinery, liquids, and temperature-sensitive cargo, our simulation system is designed to mirror the intricacies of real-world maritime logistics.

Objective: The objective of this project is to build a robust and user-friendly Java-based simulation system that enables users to understand and interact with the operational dynamics of maritime logistics. By simulating the processes of loading, unloading, and moving containers, users can experiment with different logistics strategies and gain insights into efficient container management.

Features:

Simulation of multiple container types including basic, heavy, liquid, and refrigerated.

Detailed management tools for ships and ports.

Time tracking for operations to simulate real-time logistics scenarios.

Interactive interface to coordinate the arrival and dispatch of ships.

Capability to manage the flow of containers through various port facilities
